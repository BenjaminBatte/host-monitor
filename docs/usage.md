* **Access the Dashboard:**
  Open the web dashboard in your browser (e.g., `http://localhost:4200` for dev or your deployed URL).

* **Real-Time Monitoring:**
  See host statuses, latency, packet loss, and uptime update instantly via WebSockets — no manual refresh needed.

* **Configure Hosts & Thresholds:**
